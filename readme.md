# **About Me**

Hello, my name **Akbar Ramadhan**. Im born in Jakarta, 25 Ramadhan 1416H. 

I'm Graduated from Universitas Diponegoro with a major in **Naval Architecture Engineering**.

I'm currently studying in Hacktiv8. 

A Naval Architect learn programming? Why? Weird?

I'll tell you some stories.  
Digitalization of the maritime sector in our country been a little bit late. In 2020, every ship-owner in Indonesia should be able to book for dock or repair (or even new build) for their ship digitally, via their smartphone, or web. 
Has it already been done here? nope, they still using conventional ways to do it.

Now, let's talk about marine tourism and water activities. How they do it here? can you rent a boat for some snorkeling or diving activities via your smartphone? or if there's some rich guy wanna buy a Phinisi, can they do it while laying on their bed in their luxury home? Well, it doesn't happen here. 

The renters are lack of information, the price isn't transparent. The tenant only has a limited range of market.

That's what turns me in. That's why a Naval Architect dives into the world of programming. 

I wanna fix that. I wanna join those who have moved to create a brighter future for our maritime sector.  I wanna connect those renters ant boat tenants via an online platform. I wanna close the gap between the ship-owner and the shipyard to only one click away.

I hope that one day, I can wake up to the world where our maritime sector is fully digitalized.

Salam,
Akbar.
