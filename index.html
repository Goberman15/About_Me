<h1>Akbar Ramadhan</h1>

<p>Hi, my name Akbar Ramadhan. I'm a Naval Architect currently learn programming in Hacktiv8 Coding Bootcamp. <br>
I have a dream that one day, I can wake up to the world where our maritime sector is fully digitalized. <br>
Some of my friends already on the move towards it. Check them out <a href="http://www.palapaocean.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br> Well, it's not perfect, but that just a small step to initialized thousands of gigantic steps in the future.</p> <br>


<p>Salam, <br>
Akbar.</p>
